## Script-Generation
# Create a movie script given a movie script!

This recurrent neural network project trained on a Seinfeld script attempts to generate another script.

## What You Need to Get Started
First, check out my code [here]().
Next, I would look at [this link]() and follo the recommendations/instructions on how to use this script generator.

## Prerequisite Files and Structures.
1 First, you need a Jupyter Notebook. I use mine through [Anaconda]().
2 Next, you need a GPU. This project required a pretty solid GPU for about twenty minutes. If you're following the Udacity nanodegree, one should be readily available.
3 You're also going to need the files. The link in the previous section with instructions should include said files.
4 You also need PyTorch and its corresponding libraries. You can check out some installation instructions on the [Pytorch website]().
5 There are also helper and unit test files. They are included in this repository.
6 The udacity provided files are in this repository as well as accessible at their links given in the above section.
