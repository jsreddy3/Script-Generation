## Script-Generation
# Create a movie script given a movie script!

This recurrent neural network project trained on a Seinfeld script attempts to generate another script.

## What You Need to Get Started
First, check out my code [here]().
Next, I would look at [this link]() and follo the recommendations/instructions on how to use this script generator.

## Prerequisite Files and Structures.
First, you need a Jupyter Notebook. I use mine through [Anaconda]().
Next, you need a GPU. This project required a pretty solid GPU for about twenty minutes. If you're following the Udacity nanodegree, one should be readily available.
You're also going to need the files. The link in the previous section with instructions should include said files.
You also need PyTorch and its corresponding libraries. You can check out some installation instructions on the [Pytorch website]().
